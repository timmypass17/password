## Why I made the app
One my of accounts was breached so I changed all my passwords because I used similar passwords. I got paranoid so I wrote all my passwords on a small sheet of paper but it got more diffcult to manage as time went on. Because paper is not the best way to store important information, I created this app that saves my password safely onto your device without worrying about someone having access to my account (unless someone steals my phone).
